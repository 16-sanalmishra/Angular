    Welcome to the Blogging World.
  </p>
  <p class="text-light bg-secondary p-3 border rounded">
    Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that's
    self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to
    write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites
    for many businesses. The hallmarks of blogging include frequent updates,
    informal language, and opportunities for readers to engage and start a
    conversation.

    What is Bloging?
  </p>
  <p class="text-light bg-secondary p-3 border rounded">
    The word blog is actually a shortened form of its original name, "weblog."
    These weblogs allowed early internet users to "log" the details of their day
    in diary-style entries. Blogs often allow readers to comment, so as they
    became more common, communities sprung up around popular blogs.Blogging is
    as simple as obtaining a website and publishing original content on it.
    Tech-savvy bloggers can buy a domain name and build the website themselves.
    Those with less HTML knowledge can create an account with sites like
    WordPress that simplify the web design and publishing process. Blogs are
    usually simple websites. Older pieces may be archived in separate sections
    of the site, and there may be a separate page with contact info or a bio,
    but the blog itself is usually just a single page that can be scrolled
    throughâ€”similar to the news feed on social media sites like Facebook. As
    with a Facebook news feed, a blog displays the newest content at the top of
    the page.
